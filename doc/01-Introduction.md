Introduction

The Icinga PowerShell Kickstart is a simple PowerShell script allowing users to easily install and deploy the [Icinga PowerShell Framwork](https://icinga.com/docs/windows/latest) on Windows machines by either using GitHub repositories or internal sources for the Zip-Package.

Once the Framework is installed the entire installation of Icinga Agents including many different components is possible.

The Kickstart script allows to specify a custom location for the script as well in case the Windows machines can not access the internet and only rely on internal resources.

Please have a look on the [Installation Guide of the Framework](https://icinga.com/docs/windows/latest/doc/02-Installation/) on how to proceed.
